ST7570_plc_modem
================

Hi everyone.

Im working on a project which uses a ST 7570 power line controller (PLC) modem. I found at ST webpages a pdf user manual file which describes a C library for controlling the ST7570 modem.

But only that pdf! I didnt find anywhere the source codes, the library for that!

So i found a good idea to crate an open repository for everybody who are interested in programming of power over line controller ST7570 to build up this library a share with others!

If you have a some source codes or any questions, please email me at: uhlirvoj_at_fel.cvut.cz (instead of _at_ write @).

Thank you!
